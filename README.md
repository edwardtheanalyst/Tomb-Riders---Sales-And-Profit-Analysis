# Tomb Riders â€“ Price Elasticity & Profitability Analysis  

A data-driven analysis of Tomb Ridersâ€™ rider behavior, profitability patterns, and pricing elasticity.  
This project explores hourly, daily, and seasonal trends to identify high-value periods, optimize operational strategies, and uncover opportunities for dynamic pricing. Using Power BI and SQL, we visualize revenue, profit, and rider demographics to highlight actionable insights for improving profitability and customer retention.

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights  

- **Peak Hours:** 10:00â€“15:00 and 17:00â€“19:00 drive highest profitability  
- **Top Days:** Wednesday and Friday outperform other weekdays  
- **Seasonality:** Season 3 (summer) generates over 2Ã— more revenue than Season 1 (winter)  
- **Rider Base:** 81% registered riders â€” strong retention and upsell potential  
- **Price Elasticity:** Low (2.56%) â€” room to experiment with pricing

## ðŸš€ Strategic Recommendations

- **Targeted Price Adjustment:**
Given the substantial increase in 2022, the optimal path forward is a measured price adjustment to avoid surpassing the demand ceiling. Testing a 10â€“15% price increase balances revenue growth with retention risk:

- 10% increase â†’ Price moves from $4.99 to approximately $5.49

- 15% increase â†’ Price moves from $4.99 to approximately $5.74
- **Market Intelligence Before Execution:**
Conduct structured market research to assess customer price sensitivity, competitive pricing trends, and macroeconomic conditions. This will determine whether a 10% or 15% increase is more appropriate for your specific market segments.
- **Segmented Pricing Strategy:**
Differentiate pricing for casual versus registered riders. Registered riders represent a more loyal base and could be offered subscription or loyalty-based discounts, while casual riders may absorb slightly higher rates. This maximizes revenue without alienating your core customers.

- **Iterative Testing & Monitoring:**
Roll out the new pricing in phases and closely track key performance metrics â€” customer churn, revenue per rider, and overall demand elasticity. Use these data signals to fine-tune the price point rather than committing fully upfront.

- **Dynamic Optimization:**
Develop an adaptive pricing framework that incorporates hourly, daily, and seasonal demand patterns already identified in the dashboard analysis. This allows you to charge premium rates at peak times while maintaining accessibility during off-peak periods.
